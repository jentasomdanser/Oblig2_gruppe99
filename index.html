    </div>



<p>In 2021, when speedrunner Niftski became the first person to complete Super Mario Bros. in under 4 minutes, 55 seconds, 
    we used the four-minute mile as a metaphor for the difficulty and importance of the achievement. 
    &nbsp;
</p>
<p>
    But now that Niftski has pushed that time even lower—setting a new world record of 4:54.631 for a live, 
    human-controlled full game run—we're left grasping for metaphors that accurately capture the performance.
    &nbsp;
</p>
   
<p>
    Niftski's new record perfectly matches a "perfect" TAS of the game (i.e., a "tool-assisted speedrun" that uses frame-by-frame input recordings using an emulator) 
    through seven of the run's eight levels. 
    &nbsp;
</p>
    
<p>
    His best time is now running ahead of the "theory limit" of 4:54.798 that runner Bismuth set back in 2018 as the ideal human performance standard.
    &nbsp;
</p>
   
<p>
    In the battle of man versus machine, Niftski is now just 0.35 seconds away from standing up, John Henry-style, against the standard of machine-made automation. 
</p>
   
<h2> “Lightning” in a bottle</h2>

<p>
    Most of the tricks Niftski uses to shave off precious milliseconds in this new world record run will be well-known to 
    speedrun fans and are outlined in our writeup of Niftski's 2021 world record performance. 
    &nbsp;
</p>
<p>
    The major breakthrough this time around, though, is a full-game run that integrates a "Lightning 4-2" performance, 
    which was thought to be humanly impossible until relatively recently.
    &nbsp;
</p>
<p>
    Pulling off a "Lightning 4-2" requires a pixel-perfect execution of the level's famous "wrong wrap"—where going in 
    a pipe takes the player to a warp zone that would usually require a slow climb up a vine. 
    &nbsp;
</p>
<p>
    Pulling this off quickly requires "bumping" Mario against various walls and barriers mid-jump, slightly altering his 
    position on the screen and enabling the precise positioning needed to activate the glitch.
    &nbsp;
</p>    
<p>
    For years, the TAS of the level was just a few frames ahead of methods that were considered human-viable in a "real-time attack" (RTA) speedrun. 
    &nbsp;
</p>
<p>
    But that small difference was enough for the TAS to save an entire "frame rule" over the best RTA times on the level, leaving humans a full 21 frames 
    (about 0.35 seconds) behind mechanical perfection on the level thanks to the vagaries of the game's loading times. 
    &nbsp;
</p>
<p>
    In 2018, runner HappyLee used emulation tools to lay out a new, theoretically human-viable "Lightning 4-2" strategy that matched the TAS' time down to the frame.  
    &nbsp;
</p>
<p>
    But in early 2021, Niftski used a slightly different method—integrating a pair of backward jumps over piranha plants into a wall jump off the edge of the crucial 
    "wrong warp" pipe—to become the first human to match the TAS time of 25.34 seconds in an RTA of the level. 
    &nbsp;
</p>
<p>
    Just because Lightning 4-2 was technically possible for a human didn't mean the extremely precise sequence of inputs was reliable enough to start integrating into 
    full-game speedruns, though.
    &nbsp;
</p>
<p>
    But that changed recently as runner KingOfJohnnyBoy helped develop a more consistent Lightning 4-2 method that involves bumping off of a question-mark block, rather 
    than a moving platform, to quickly set up the crucial wrong warp" positioning. 
    &nbsp;
</p>
<p>
    With that new method in place, "this framerule that was once thought to be impossible has now been implemented in runs," as Niftski said on YouTube. 
    &nbsp;
</p>
<p>
    But to get the new world record, Niftski would have to pull off the extremely tricky Lightning 4-2 in a run that also included multiple "fast acceleration" starts and 
    punishingly precise glitches to skip the flagpole animation at the end of each level (including an exceptionally hard one in 8-2 that requires bouncing off a precisely 
    placed Bullet Bill).
    &nbsp;
</p>

<h2>The push for perfection</h2>

    <a class="bottom-left" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4CgC2g43smA&t=1750s">Thanks to new techniques, Niftski has now beaten the previous "theory limit" laid out by Youtuber Bismuth in 2018.</a>
</div>

<p>
    The full video of Niftski stringing all that together includes a lot of extremely loud exclamations, 
    especially after he realizes he's pulled off his second "Lightning 4-2" in a row during a run that has been otherwise perfect. 
   
    &nbsp;
</p>
<p>
    His heart rate, as displayed on screen during the livestream, starts increasing before topping out at 188 bpm by the end of 8-4 
    ("I am completely healthy and do not have any heart condition!" he assures viewers in the YouTube description).
    &nbsp;
</p>
<p>
    When the run is complete, Niftski pops off into a tearful, repeated exclamation of "Oh my god!" and tells himself to "Get oxygen, dude" 
    as he realizes the enormity of what he's done.
    &nbsp;
</p>
<p>
    With seven "perfect" levels strung together in a single run, Niftski's last remaining hurdle is to put it all together with an 8-4 that is just 22 frames faster to match the TAS.
    &nbsp;
</p>
<p>
    That would set a record that would be literally unbeatable, even by a machine, until and unless some currently unknown strategies were discovered to save even more time.
    &nbsp;
</p>
<p>
    "As much as I've stressed how amazing this run is to me, this is not my end goal, and I will not be stopping here!" Niftski writes on YouTube. 
    "I plan to take this category as low as possible."
